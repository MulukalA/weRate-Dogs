### Introduction

WeRateDogs is a twitter account which share dog images and write a brief panegyric about the dog, then they let their followers to rate it by favoriting it. By asking WeRateDogs to share with us some of their tweets, they did. They have shared 5000+ of their tweets which contains some basic data. Sometimes in their brief panegyric they mention the breed of the dog, and some others they donâ€™t. But thanks to Udacity, they have performed some neutral network 
procedures to classify the dogs based on their images which are shared with the tweets

This report communicates the insights and displays the visualizations produced from the wrangled data.

The dataset that was wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates,  These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

The entirety of this project was completed inside the Udacity classroom on the Project Workspace. However, the reports were created and exported as PDFs using Microsoft Word.

#### Objective
